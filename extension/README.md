# JSON Prettier

JSON Prettier is your all in one helper for working with JSON in Google Chrome. It turns tangled API responses into clean, readable structures so you can understand data faster, debug errors, and share examples with your team. With one click the extension transforms any raw payload into a pretty output that feels like reading normal text instead of noise.
